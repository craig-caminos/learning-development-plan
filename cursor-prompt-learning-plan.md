# Interactive Learning and Development Plan Web App - Development Request

## Context
I am a non-developer looking to create an Interactive Learning and Development Plan web application. I need the application to be easily deployable on my Mac without requiring complex development environment setup. The solution should be self-contained and straightforward to run.

## Project Goal
Develop a containerized web application for Interactive Learning and Development Plan that can be easily run on a Mac with minimal prerequisites. The only things I should need to install are Docker Desktop and Git.

## Development Requirements

1. Docker-First Approach:
   - Package the entire application (frontend, backend, and database) in Docker containers
   - Provide a docker-compose.yml file that orchestrates all services
   - Include detailed instructions for installing Docker Desktop on Mac
   - Ensure all dependencies are handled within the containers

2. Simple Setup Process:
   - Create a single setup script (setup.sh) that handles all configuration
   - Provide clear, step-by-step instructions for non-developers
   - Include troubleshooting guidance for common issues
   - Minimize required command-line usage

3. Local Development:
   - Ensure hot-reloading works within Docker containers
   - Make file changes easily visible in the running application
   - Provide clear instructions for viewing logs and debugging

## Functional Requirements

1. User Features:
   - Simple user registration and login
   - Create and edit learning development plans
   - View saved plans
   - Export plans as PDF
   - Auto-save functionality

2. Data Storage:
   - Use MongoDB (containerized)
   - Persist data between container restarts
   - Include backup/restore functionality

3. User Interface:
   - Clean, modern design using shadcn/ui components
   - Responsive layout for desktop and mobile
   - Intuitive navigation
   - Error handling with user-friendly messages

## Technical Stack

1. Frontend:
   - React with Vite for faster development
   - Tailwind CSS for styling
   - shadcn/ui component library
   - PDF export functionality

2. Backend:
   - Node.js with Express
   - MongoDB for data storage
   - JWT authentication

3. Infrastructure:
   - Docker containers for all components
   - Docker Compose for orchestration
   - Automated environment setup

## Setup Instructions (to be included in README.md)
1. Prerequisites:
   - Install Docker Desktop for Mac
   - Install Git

2. Getting Started:
   ```bash
   # Clone the repository
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd [project-directory]

   chmod +x setup.sh
   ./setup.sh

   # Start the application
   docker-compose up
   ```

3. Accessing the Application:
   - Open browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000
   - Default admin credentials (if applicable)
   - How to stop the application

## Base Component Code
[Previous React component code remains the same as in the original prompt]

## Additional Requirements

1. Documentation:
   - Clear README.md with setup instructions
   - Troubleshooting guide
   - Basic user guide
   - Instructions for backing up data

2. Error Handling:
   - Graceful error handling in the UI
   - Clear error messages for setup issues
   - Logging for troubleshooting

3. Performance:
   - Quick startup time for containers
   - Efficient data loading and saving
   - Smooth user experience

## Deliverables

1. Complete source code with:
   - All necessary Docker configurations
   - Frontend and backend code
   - Database initialization scripts
   - Setup and utility scripts

2. Documentation:
   - Detailed README.md
   - Setup troubleshooting guide
   - User guide
   - Architecture overview

## Important Notes for Cursor AI

1. Please generate code in complete, working segments that can be directly copied and used.

2. Include detailed comments explaining key components and configuration options.

3. Provide step-by-step instructions for implementing each part of the application.

4. Highlight any potential issues that might arise during setup and their solutions.

5. Test instructions should be written with non-developers in mind.

## Timeline
Please provide an estimated timeline for delivering this solution, including any potential challenges that might affect the implementation.
